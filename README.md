# Monet GAN Kaggle Competition

The goal of this project is to use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate a set of jpg images that look like they were painted by Claude Monet, and then submit these images to a Kaggle competition. We are given a collection of small Monet images to use for training, and a collection of small photos to use as the basis for image generation.
